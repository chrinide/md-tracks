Depends: python-numpy (>= 1.0.1), python-matplotlib, python-molmod (>=0.002)
Suggests: 
ShortDescription: Specialized scripts for MD/MC trajectory analysis.
LongDescription: The scripts assume that the trajectory files are given in the xyz format.
 As an example, vibrational density analysis is implemented, but the tracks
 python module can be easily used to create hand-crafted analysis tools.
