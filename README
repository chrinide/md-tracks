Short description
-----------------

Tracks is a collection of molecular dynamics and monte carlo analysis scripts.
It is designed to be simple in use, extensible with home-made scripts, and yet
powerfull to do the more complex analysis on large simulations.

More information about Tracks can be found on the CMM Code website:
http://molmod.ugent.be/code/

The following software has to be installed on your system before you can use
Tracks:
 1) Python (>=2.4, <3.0): see http://www.python.org/
 2) Numpy (>=1.0.1): see http://www.scipy.org/
 3) MolMod (>= 0.003): see http://molmod.ugent.be/code/


How to install
--------------

There are several ways to install Tracks, which are all documented
at the homepage: http://molmod.ugent.be/code/


How to get technical support
----------------------------

Technical support is availlable for all registered CMM Code users. All

Become a registered user
------------------------

There are 5 good reasons to become a registered user:

 1.  Through your registration, we can prove that people are really using
 softwarde developed at the Center for Molecular Modeling for their 
 scientific work. This facilitates the fund-raising process and guarantees 
 the continuity of these projects.

 2. It blocks spammers from unauthorized access to all online CMM Code
 services.
 
 3. A registered user can subscribe to the CMM Code mailing lists.
 
 4. A registered user is allowed to edit the wiki pages to increase the
 visibility of his/her related work.
 
 5. Registered users are allowed to submit bugs. If time permits, we will fix
 your problems in the next bug-fix release of Tracks.
